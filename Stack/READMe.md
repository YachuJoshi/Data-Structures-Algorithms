## Stack

- **Stack** is an abstract data structure with a bounded size.
- It works in **Last In First Out(LIFO)** Principle: The most recent item to be added to the stack gets removed first.

### Basic Operations:

- **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Remove an element from the top of the stack & return it.
- **IsEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.
- **IsFull:** Check if the stack is full.
- **Peek:** Get the value at the top of the stack.
