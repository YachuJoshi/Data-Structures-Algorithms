## Queue

- **Queue** is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
- It works in **First In First Out(FIFO)** Principle: The oldest item added to the queue is the first to get removed.

### Basic Operations:

- **Enqueue:** Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Remove an element from the front of the queue & return it.
- **IsEmpty:** Check if the queue is empty.
- **IsFull:** Check if the queue is full.
- **Peek:** Get the value at the front of the queue.
