## Circular Queue

- **Circular Queue** avoids the wastage of space in a regular queue implementation using arrays.

### How Circular Queue Works

- Circular Queue works by the process of circular increment i.e when we increase the pointers and it reaches the end, we reset it to the beginning of the queue.
